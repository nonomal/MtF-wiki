## The Process

The main place to get HRT is [Changi General Hospital](https://www.cgh.com.sg/).

The process consists of two steps:

1. Psychiatrist visit (for a gender dysphoria diagnosis)
1. Endocrinology visit (for obtaining an HRT prescription)

Singaporeans may first get a referral from a polyclinic to Changi General Hospital for government subsidies.

- For 18- to 20-year-olds, consent from both parents is required before HRT can commence.
- Under 18 years old, NO HRT is given.
